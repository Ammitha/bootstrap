                Bihu is the national festival of Assam, which marks three distinct phases of the farming calendar for paddy, the native crop of Assam. The people of Assam celebrate three types of Bihu every year â€“ Rongaali Bihu, Kati Bihu and Magh Bihu. Rongaali Bihu or Bohaag Bihu is celebrated in the month of Bohaag (middle of April) and marks the beginning of the seeding time. It is the chief Bihu of all the three and is celebrated over a period of several days. The Kati Bihu, also known as Kongaali Bihu, marks the completion of sowing of paddy and transplantation of saplings. The Magh Bihu or the Bhogaali Bihu celebrates the culmination of the harvesting period.

                Traditionally, Bihu is celebrated with folk dance and songs which are symbolic of communication of love and romance. Today, cultural programs are held based on Bihu dance and songs, accompanied by traditional musical instruments like the Dhol, Toka, Pepa, etc. Kati Bihu is celebrated in the middle of October, when people perform silent prayer by lighting earthen lamps in the paddy fields. On the other hand, Bhogaali Bihu is celebrated in January after the cultivation is harvested. Bihu festival is celebrated with immense zeal and passion, irrespective of caste, creed and religion.
