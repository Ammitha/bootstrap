                Kathakali is the most well known dance drama from the south In­dian state of Kerala.  The word Kathakali literally means "Story-Play".  It is known for its large, elaborate makeup and costumes.  The elaborate costumes of Kathakali have become the most re­cog­nised icon for Kerala.The themes of the Kathakali are religious in nature.  They typically deal with the Mahabarat, the Ramayana and the ancient scriptures known as the Puranas.  This is performed in a text which is generally Sanskritised Malayalam.

                A Kathakali performance is a major social event.  They generally start at dusk and go through out the night.  Kathakali is usually performed only by men.  Female cha­rac­ters are portrayed by men dressed in women's costume.  However, in recent years, women have started to become Kathakali dan­cers.
                
                Kathakali has a long tradition.  It dates back to the 17th century.  It was given its pres­ent form by Mahakavi Vallathol Narayan Menon, who was the founder of the Kerala Kala Mandalam.
                
                The actors rely very heavily on hand gesture to convey the story.  These hand gestures, known as mudra, are com­mon through out much of classical In­dian dance.
